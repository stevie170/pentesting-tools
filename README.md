# Pentesting Tools
This repository is a collection of external tools that are helpful during penetration testing and ethical hacking.
I will be continually adding tools as I find them, and notes as I learn more about how to use them.

## Server Side Template Injection Flowchart

https://portswigger.net/research/server-side-template-injection includes a helpful flowchart to help identify the template engine in use.
>After detecting template injection, the next step is to identify the template engine in use. This step is sometimes as trivial as submitting invalid syntax, as template engines may identify themselves in the resulting error messages. However, this technique fails when error messages are supressed, and isn't well suited for automation. We have instead automated this in Burp Suite using a decision tree of language-specific payloads. Green and red arrows represent 'success' and 'failure' responses respectively. In some cases, a single payload can have multiple distinct success responses - for example, the probe '{{7*'7'}}' would result in 49 in Twig, 7777777 in Jinja2, and neither if no template language is in use.
