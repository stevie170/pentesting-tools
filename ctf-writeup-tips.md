# Tips for a good CTF write-up

## General Tips

These tips came from an [old reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityCTF/comments/fkquwm/ctf_writeups_cheatsheet/): 

- include the task analysis with clear explanations for what you found, don't assume something is "obvious" (because it might not be)
- explain the task itself, so that someone without in-depth knowledge of the challenge can also understand the idea
- include intermediate steps, eg. for crypto don't just write `we arrive at equation XYZ`, but actually provide the calculations
- include code snippets and examples/sanity checks for intermediate steps to "show" what is going on
- put your writeup in proper order, so it can be followed

## Cheatsheet

I really like this [Cheatsheet from P+NP CTF TEAM on Github](https://pequalsnp-team.github.io/cheatsheet/writing-good-writeup). 

>### Required Information
>If you are writing a Write-up for a CTF, there are some information that you NEED to include. These information are:
>- CTF name
>- Challenge name
>- Challenge description
>- Challenge category => so users know the chall’s field
>- Challenge points => so users know the chall’s difficulty
>- CTF Year and Date [OPTIONAL] => so users know if it’s outdated
>
>### Content
>**When writing your content don’t be too greedy.**
>I’ve seen some Write-up made up of a to-do list, some made of just Python/JS code with no comment whatsoever.
>
>You have to explain the _exact sequence of thoughts_ you went through to go from A to B.
>“I have `2`, I know that `2 + 2 = flag` so I made this script that computes `2 + 2` and I got the flag” 
>Just don’t post your code without a description or some comments please.
>
>If you used an already existing script from somewhere else, be sure to back it up. Too many times people post links to their source code that after some time result broken.
>
>**When writing your content don’t be too verbose.**
>I mean, _you can_, but **(at the top) insert an abstract/summary as a _TL;DR_ (at least 50 words)**
>
>Don’t forget that if you include too many useless details you _will result boring_.
>So you can use some memes pic or write some jokes to keep the readers glued to the screen.
>
>### Extra Points
>You get _GOLDEN SHINING_ Extra points if:
>
>You use **bold**, _italic_ or **_both_** to enhance the Content’s key-point.
>You add **some screenshots**.
>You **correctly format** small code snippet, path, strings, etc.
>Your write-up is reproducible (You must attach the challenge source-code, sometimes this can’t be done).
>Your write-up is **multilingual** (**English is a priority. At least for TL;DRs**).

## Publishing to multiple formats

This is a [great how-to by Ryan Kozak](https://ryankozak.com/how-i-do-my-ctf-writeups/).  

>I wanted to post the writeups on my blog and publish them as PDFs. Writing the whole thing in a document editor is miserable, I hate using document editors. Then doing the whole thing again as a blog post just means even more work. So, here’s the workflow I developed this summer to do my writeups once using markdown, and easily publish in both formats.

I find his method very interesting, and am saving it here to implement in the future. He first creates the write-up as a password protected pdf (built from markdown), then when the box is retired he continues through his workflow to make the write-up public on his blog.
